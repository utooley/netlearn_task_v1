# netlearn_task_v1
Network learning task in PsychoPy

For each subject, set subject exposure walks first with _set_subj_walks.py_, then run the whole task and assessments with _netlearn_kids_v1.py_.

_experiment_config.py_ has experimental parameters of the exposure walk and assessments, and _config.py_ has visual and config parameters.
